# Project Lake Shore Drive — Design System Transformation SCRUB Microprompts

> Codex-oriented, seam-by-seam prompts for transforming **https://github.com/lannodev/angular-tailwind** into the production Lake Shore Drive Design System.

## Purpose

This document builds the design system **outside the main Lake Shore Drive feature implementation sequence**. The public starter is a source of Angular/Tailwind implementation material; the canonical Lake Shore Drive requirements remain the authority.

The starter currently provides Angular 22, Tailwind 4, standalone components, Signals, multiple themes, sidebar/navbar/dashboard/auth examples, Playwright E2E capability, and an MIT license. The goal is not to preserve an admin template. The goal is to **curate, harden, normalize, document, and package a first-class architecture-workbench design system**.

## Required target

The final drop-in source lives at:

`src/web/design-system/`

with the required layers:

```text
src/web/design-system/
  tokens/
  foundations/
  primitives/
  components/
  patterns/
  recipes/
  layouts/
  icons/
  utilities/
  documentation/
```

## Non-negotiable operating rules

- **One prompt = one primary change.** Never combine cleanup, redesign, migration, and feature work in one step.
- Open `docs/requirements/requirements.md` before every implementation step that changes behavior.
- Requirements and approved ADRs win over the starter repository.
- Preserve applicable third-party license/attribution notices.
- Angular 22 standalone APIs and signals-first state are the default.
- Tailwind is an implementation mechanism **behind** the design system, not the feature-facing design API.
- Semantic tokens replace direct palette/color decisions in production components.
- WCAG 2.2 AA behavior is part of component correctness.
- Light/dark appearance must be token-driven.
- AI-generated/suggested content must remain visually distinguishable from architect-approved content.
- Do not pull product APIs, persistence, auth services, AI provider logic, or feature-domain models into the design system.
- Every production public component/recipe requires documentation and test evidence.
- Every prompt ends with verification and `STOP`.

## Codex handoff rule

Execute these prompts **in order**. Do not ask Codex to “build the design system” in one pass. Commit after coherent verified seams. If a step exposes a requirement conflict or missing architectural decision, stop that sequence, resolve the decision, then continue.

# Completion definition

The transformation is complete only when:

1. `src/web/design-system/` matches DS-003 layering.
2. Public design-system imports are explicit and private imports are enforceably blocked.
3. Feature-facing visual APIs are semantic rather than copied Tailwind bundles.
4. Required primitives, components, patterns, recipes, layouts, and AI UX states exist.
5. Light/dark, responsive, keyboard, focus, error, reduced-motion, and screen-reader behaviors are verified.
6. Every production component/recipe is documented.
7. Visual-regression and accessibility suites pass.
8. Starter demo/business code and unused dependencies are removed.
9. License/attribution obligations are preserved.
10. The drop-in integration manifest is complete and the output is ready for `src/web/design-system/` in Project Lake Shore Drive.
